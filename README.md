> The folder structure must remain unchanged for all the resources to be auto loaded and configured.

#### Directory Structure

1. **/resources/assets** - Contains all the javascript, css, sass files used in the website. Any files in this folder will be automatically minified, merged and served.
2. **/resources/views** - Contains the HTML source files of the website. The extension of all files in this folder should be ```.html```. Any other extension will be ignored.

jQuery, Bootstrap and the Anokha javascript API will be automatically served and need not be added to the assets directory.
